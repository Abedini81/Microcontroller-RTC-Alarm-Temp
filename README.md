# Microcontroller-RTC-Alarm-Temp
A microcontroller-based RTC system with Solar Hijri date, alarm functionality, and temperature monitoring displayed on an LCD.

This project implements a real-time clock (RTC) system using an ATmega32 microcontroller. It features precise timekeeping with the DS1307 RTC module, Solar Hijri date conversion, an alarm system, and temperature measurement using the LM35 sensor. The user can interact with the system through buttons, with all information displayed on a character LCD. Settings such as alarms are stored in EEPROM for persistence. This project demonstrates practical applications of microcontroller-based systems in time management and environmental monitoring.
